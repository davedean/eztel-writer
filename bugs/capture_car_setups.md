## Car Setup Data Not Captured

we could capture "car setup", so that local players can benefit from opponents setups. 

We could either  capture them in the lap file, or as a serparate output file, probably in a setups directory?

It would be important to be able to correlate a setup to a "best lap time", so that users know not to waste time with slow/bad setups.

Unclear how best to do this.


**Status**: Enhancement
**Priority**: Low

Currently the car setup section shows all zeros. Need to map setup data from shared memory if available.
