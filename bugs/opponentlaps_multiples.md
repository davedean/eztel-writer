I notice that we are saving more than one opponent lap per opponent, maybe because of the timestamp in the filename?

eg:

in one session just then we saved two from the same driver:

2025-11-20_17-24_sebring-international-raceway_gt3_unknown_felicio-tamaja_lap1_t129s
2025-11-20_17-26_sebring-international-raceway_gt3_unknown_felicio-tamaja_lap2_t127s


If use the "session id" instead of the date/time would help us keep just one opponent lap per session, we should move to that.
